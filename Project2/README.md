# Project 2 investigat a dataset
\
The medical record data set is selected for this project from the [database](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5ac7a08a_investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb/investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb.zip)


## Requirement of this project 
### 1 Analyse your data
* Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the data set options to help you get started.

* Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

### 2 Share your findings
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.
